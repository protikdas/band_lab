                        <br>
                        <br> The Cure are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex in 1976. The band has experienced
                        several line-up changes, with vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the
                        only constant member.
                        <br>
                        <br> Their debut single "Killing an Arab" (1978) and debut album Three Imaginary Boys (1979) were
                        important records in the development of the post-punk and new wave movements that developed in the
                        wake of the punk rock scene in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly
                        dark and tormented music (as well as Smith's unique stage look) was a staple of the emerging style
                        of music known as gothic rock.
                        <br>
                        <br> Following the release of the album Pornography in 1982, the band's future was uncertain. Smith
                        was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired, introducing a greater pop sensibility
                        into the band's music. Songs such as "Let's Go to Bed" (1982), "Just Like Heaven" (1987), "Lovesong"
                        (1989), and "Friday I'm in Love" (1992) aided the band in receiving commercial popularity. The band
                        is estimated to have sold roughly 27 million records as of 2004 and have released thirteen studio
                        albums, ten EPs, and over thirty singles to date.
